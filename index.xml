      <title>Writing and Testing Verilog on macOS / Linux (and even Android) with Icarus Verilog</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you like me? You&amp;rsquo;re in class, asked to write Verilog using Quartus II, only to find out it&amp;rsquo;s a Windows-only application? Σ(&amp;rsquo;◉⌓◉’) This leaves us students with Macs or Linux installations staring blankly at our screens. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry! This post will tell you how to handle Verilog design on macOS and Linux, and even do some proof-of-concept testing! * (You can even run it on Android phones/tablets!)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Transform Your Chromebook into a Docker Dev Machine with Virtual Disks</title>
      <link>/posts/2025-06-05-docker-on-img/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! Recently, I had an old, unused Chromebook lying around. Thinking it&amp;rsquo;s a shame to let it gather dust, I got the idea to turn it into a simple Docker development server. After all, using a lightweight machine for lightweight services makes many things much more convenient.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Explore Kenting for Free with TPASS: Commute from Kaohsiung Main Station to Hengchun and Kenting – All Free!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To save money on commuting between Kaohsiung and Tainan recently, I purchased the Southern Taiwan (Nangaoping) TPASS.  This guide provides some strategies for exploring Kenting affordably. If you&amp;rsquo;re a foreigner visiting Taiwan and plan to stay in Southern Taiwan for close to a month, purchasing the TPASS is also highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CSSC - EP.3: Instruction Set Analysis</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I felt unwell after getting a vaccine, so I paused updates for a while. And finally, the semester is over! Although there will be many decisions influenced by what I made during the finals period, I now have more time to think about more details (´▽｀)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the project progressed, I realized more and more that designing a computer architecture is not such a simple task&amp;hellip; Initially, I just brainstormed and simulated in my head, but later on, I found that Uxn&amp;rsquo;s basic instruction set alone has 32 instructions, and with 3 mode combinations, there are a total of 256 instructions. Designing a CPU for 256 instructions is truly a challenging endeavor for a university freshman&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CSSC - EP.2: Homebrew a Simple Signal Analyzer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the previous article, I mentioned that I had completed the design and implementation of Register A, B, and the ALU. However, during the actual implementation process, I found that when operating and debugging signals, relying solely on LEDs for visual inspection made it difficult to directly observe specific signal changes. Therefore, I decided to implement a logic analysis tool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CSSC - EP.1 : The Starting Point</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the blog was set up relatively late, a lot of content has accumulated, which I&amp;rsquo;ll be catching up on in the next few posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The designs for the components I&amp;rsquo;m about to introduce were actually implemented on breadboards several years &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; this project even began. This time, with the school&amp;rsquo;s final project deadline approaching, I decided to revisit my previous work and incorporate new ideas, embarking on a brand-new CPU project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CSSC - EP.0 Teaser: How About Designing a Computer? - Stack CPU</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the semester drew to a close, each of us was required by our teacher to submit a project for the Digital Circuit Design course, assembled using at least the 74 series ICs. That&amp;rsquo;s when a bold idea suddenly struck me: why not design a computer?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
